## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between large-scale cloud infrastructure development and housing price dynamics in Chicago between 2000 and 2025. Specifically, we analyze whether the construction and operation of data centers are associated with measurable changes in local housing costs.

We collected and cleaned data center location data and constructed a curated dataset of confirmed facilities with a first_permit variable approximating when each data center began development or operations. We then integrate this dataset with historical housing price data at the ZIP code level to explore spatial and temporal patterns.

The project combines data cleaning, record linkage, and geospatial visualization techniques to generate an index trend, heat map, and other visual tools that help describe potential correlations between data center expansion and housing price changes. Our goal is not to claim causation, but to provide a data-driven foundation for understanding how digital infrastructure may interact with urban housing markets.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Deduplication** — Consolidates and cleans raw data center and housing records, removing duplicates and unmatched entries.
- **Chicago-Focused Dataset** — Filters national data to construct a curated dataset of confirmed Chicago data centers and housing prices.
- **First Permit Construction** — Builds a first_permit variable to approximate when each data center began development or operations.
- **Housing Market Integration** — Merges data center data with ZIP code–level housing price data (2000–2025).
- **Spatial & Temporal Visualization** — Generates trend index, heat map, and other visualizations to explore correlations between infrastructure expansion and housing prices.

## Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|---|---|
| [Data Center Map](https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/illinois/chicago/) | A publicly accessible directory of data center facilities in the Chicago metropolitan area, listing sites with basic location and provider information. The database aggregates facility listings from operators and external sources to provide insight into the presence and distribution of data infrastructure in Chicago. |
| [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) | A comprehensive public repository from Zillow that provides historical and current data on U.S. housing markets. The site offers downloadable datasets such as the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), which tracks home prices across regions and over time, making it useful for analyzing housing price trends. |

## Data Processing & Reconciliation

This project integrates infrastructure, housing, and demographic data from multiple sources. Data center locations were scraped and geocoded for spatial analysis. Housing price data (Zillow) was aggregated from monthly to annual values to align with socioeconomic indicators retrieved via the Census API (ACS 5-year estimates). All datasets were reconciled using geographic identifiers (ZIP codes and Census tracts) to enable spatial and temporal analysis.

See DataProcess.md  for full documentation of the reconciliation and cleaning process.

## Data Methodology

To evaluate how data center concentration relates to neighborhood affordability, we construct a composite index at the ZIP code level. The index integrates housing costs, demographic characteristics, and the number of data centers within each ZIP code into a single comparative measure.

We standardize each variable using a decile-based ranking approach, assigning ZIP codes to ten equally sized bins based on empirical quantiles. Lower deciles correspond to lower relative scores, while higher deciles indicate comparatively higher values. These standardized scores are then combined using a weighted average to produce a Composite Index score for each ZIP code.

As an alternative specification, we also implement a z-score normalization approach, which standardizes variables by centering them around the mean and scaling by their standard deviation. This allows comparison across variables with different units of measurement and captures relative deviations rather than rank positions.

Higher Composite Index scores indicate ZIP codes that are comparatively less affordable, while lower scores reflect relatively more affordable areas.

For full technical documentation and mathematical formulation, see DataMethodology.md￼.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.10+
- git uv package manager
- Git
- R (for spatial processing scripts)

### General installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/project-datacenter-urban-effects.git

# Navigate into the project
cd project-datacenter-urban-effects
```

### Install Python dependencies

Using uv:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Configuration

1. Ensure all required datasets are located in the data/ directory.
2. Verify file paths inside Python scripts (e.g., data/top_us_cities_datacenters.csv) match your local structure.

---

## Usage

The project can be used in two main ways, you can reproduce the data pipeline or run the interactive dashboard

**Reproduce the Data Pipeline**

From the project root:

```bash
# Clean and filter Chicago data centers
uv run python_scripts/chicago_data_centers.py

# Process Zillow housing data
uv run python_scripts/zillow_data.py

# Prepare merged dataset for dashboard
uv run python_scripts/preparing_data_for_dashboard.py
```

This will:
1. Filter data centers to Chicago
2. Construct the first_permit variable
3. Merge housing and infrastructure datasets
4. Generate cleaned outputs in the data/ directory

**Run the Dashboard**

Navigate to the dashboard directory:
```bash
cd shini_app
```
Then run:
```bash
python app.py
```

This launches the interactive visualization environment, including:
1. Data center heat map
2. Housing price trends (2000–2025)
3. ZIP-level spatial overlays
4. Composite index scoring
